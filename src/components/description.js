                    I know... that might seem a little bit smug, but it is nothing but the truth.
                    We select our coffee from the best farms of the world, and then our staff toast and
                    grind the grains with a really wonderful and secret strategy. But then this coffee doesn't 
                    go to our customers table yet, before that we include incredible ingredients that no 
                    other coffee shop does, and finally we add an extra layer of cream according to our 
                    customer's preference. All strictly elaborated in order to delight every customer in a 
                    special way, so that they will always want to come back and take another amazing experience,
                    that is always completely new even though they choose the same drink everytime.
